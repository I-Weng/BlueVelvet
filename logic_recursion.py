############ Q1. Ask the user for an integer, multiply it by itself + 1, and print the result
# Topic: user input

prompt = int(input("Type any random integer:"))
print (prompt * (prompt + 1))

############ Q2. Ask the user for an integer
# If it is an even number, print "even"
# If it is an odd number, print "odd"

# Topic: conditionals, user input

prompt = int(input("Type any random integer:"))
if prompt % 2 == 0:
    print ("even")
else:
    print ("odd")

############# Q3. Iterate through each element in the list USING A FOR LOOP, add 5 to it, and print them 
# Topic: loops + lists

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Code here

for value in numbers:
    print(value + 5)

# ############# Q4. Iterate through the list and only print values that are divisible by 3 ############
# Topic: lists, loops, conditions, comparison operators

numbers = list(range(0, 500))

# Hint: You can use len() function

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Code here






############# Q7. For the following list:
# Print ALL numbers divisible by 7 and label them like so: "Divisible by 7: 70"
# Print ALL numbers divisible by 3 and label them like so: "Divisible by 3: 6"
# Print ALL numbers divisible by 3 and 7 and label them like so: "Divisible by 3 and 7: 21"
